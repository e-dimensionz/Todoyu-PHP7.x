Instructions to install todoyu
==============================

	the files are available in .zip format and can be extracted using most compression tools.

	2. Upload the files to your webserver via FTP.
	Upload the files to the root of your webspace or to a custom sub directory.

	3. Create a MySql database and a respective user with sufficient database privileges
	(such as the ability to create tables). Take note of the user name, password, database name
	and hostname as you create the database. You will enter this information during the installation.

		* install/config
		* config/db.php
		* config/extensions.php
		* config/extconf.php
		* config/system.php
		* index.html

	5. Run the install script.
	To run the todoyu installer, point your browser to the URL of your website where you uploaded todoyu
	(http://wwww.example.org/ if you uploaded todoyu to the root of your webspace,
	or http://www.example.org/todoyu/ if you uploaded the files to a sub directory named "todoyu")

	6. Follow the instructions of the installer.
