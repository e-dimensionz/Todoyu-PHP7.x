# Todoyu for PHP7!

**!!! IMPORTANT RE: PHP 8 Support! The new repo is [here](https://github.com/e-dimensionz/Todoyu-PHP8.x)**

**THE CODE IS UNSTABLE AND NOT READY FOR USE YET!**

We are getting there. We use this software as well so we are desperate to getting it live. Any help would speed up progress

---

This is the latest version of `todoyu` ported/modded to work with PHP 7.x.
I worked all the bugs I could find so far.

Revived by [WyldCode](https://wyldcode.com) a subsidiary of [e-dimensionz, Inc](https://e-dimensionz.com)  

# Todoyu Project Management

Todoyu was one of the best Open Source Self-Hosted Software for Project
and Task Management, Time Tracking and Team Collaboration. Sadly, this
project was abandoned years ago and never worked on PHP7.x. This is a fork
created from the main repository and parsed/moddified to work with PHP7
as well as MySQLi.

Enjoy.

Please create issues here to submit your bugs.

We have been thinking of continuing support for `todoyu` (since we
actively use it). We would also like to get your feedback on which features
or integrations you would like added. Any useful APIs that would take
Todoyu to do next level?

We are also taking suggestions on new names for this revival fork.

If you like this revival, Please buy us a beer :)
