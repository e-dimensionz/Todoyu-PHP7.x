# Todoyu for PHP7!

This is the latest version of `todoyu` modded to work with PHP 7.x.
I worked all the bugs I could find so far.

# Todoyu Project Management

Todoyu was one of the best Open Source Software for Project and Task
Management, Time Tracking and Team Collaboration. Sadly, this project
was abandoned years ago and never worked on PHP7.x. This is a fork
created from the main repository and parsed/moddified to work with PHP7
as well as MySQLi.

Enjoy.

Please create issues here to submit your bugs.

We have been thinking of continuing support for `todoyu` (since we
actively use it). We would also like to get your feedback on which features
or integrations you would like added. Any useful APIs that would take
Todoyu to do next level?

We are also taking suggestions on new names for this revival fork.

If you like this revival, Please buy us a beer :)
